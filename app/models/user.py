    User model is the place to store all the information related to the user
    It should have also a password field that is being hashed before stored
    For this purpose we can create a method similar to Django: set_password
    The user should also have a flag is_admin (False by default)
    Admins are the ones that can create other users
    as well as some other stuff that cannot be done by regular users
    There should be a foreignKey relationship between the user and the company
    i.e. A company can have many users, but a user is assigned only to one company
    Other info are:
    username
    email
    phone number
